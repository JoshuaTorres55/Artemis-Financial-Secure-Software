# Artemis-Financial-Secure-Software
Documentation and reflection for secure software practices implemented for Artemis Financial.

The Artemis Financial Secure Software Project was created to address critical security gaps in the company's software systems. As a consulting firm dealing with sensitive financial data, Artemis Financial required robust solutions to protect client information and ensure secure operations. This project focused on implementing modern encryption, secure communication protocols, and data integrity verification to meet the company's needs. 

The completed project includes key enhancements such as checksum verification, which ensures the integrity of transmitted files, and the implementation of HTTPS for encrypted communication between clients and servers. These measures provide an added layer of protection against unauthorized access and tampering. In addition, a thorough analysis of third-party dependencies was conducted using static vulnerability scanning tools to eliminate potential security risks associated with external libraries. The codebase was refactored to incorporate secure coding practices, aligning with industry standards and best practices to further strengthen the software's resilience against threats. 

The project has been successfully integrated into Artemis Financial's existing systems, enhancing their ability to manage sensitive data securely. While the core objectives of the project have been achieved, opportunities for further improvement remain. These include the potential integration of automated deployment pipelines to streamline updates and the replacement of self-signed certificates with certificates from trusted certificate authorities to enhance production-level security. 

The project demonstrates the application of secure software development principles in a real-world context and highlights the importance of proactively addressing cybersecurity challenges.
